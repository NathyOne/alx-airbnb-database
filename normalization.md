# Normalization Process

# 1st Normal from
-All attributes must have atomic (indivisible) values.
-No repeating groups or arrays.
-Each table must have a primary key.
-The table was already in 1st normal form.

# 2nd Normal form.
- The second normal form is achieved.
- normally second normal form happens where is there is composite primary key.
- all non-key attritutes are fully functionally dependant on the primary key.

# 3 normal form
- there is one issue that i think might violate 3rd normal form 
- the total price attribute in the booking table.
- i want to leave like it is and learn what should it cause later on.
